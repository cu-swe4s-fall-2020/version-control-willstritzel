Get familiar with version control basics

the latest math_lib.py is the most recent of many versions, I had to pracice working with this environment and these new
concepts a lot. Hopefully the document works as intended.



Now calculate.py exists, calling the module math_lib.py as ml, and using its functions. however, I think i'm having problems since it looks like its using an old version of math_lib.py


fixed several errors in all documents





Now everyting needs to be updated, I've been forgetting to add modified files in the commit for a branch
